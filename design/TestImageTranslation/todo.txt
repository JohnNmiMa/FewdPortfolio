Put wide image in square container - DONE
Put tall image in square container - DONE
Move the image with mouse on hover - DONE
Use background-position to put image anywhere in the container - DONE
	Understand how percentages work - DONE
	Understand if any clipping occurs - DONE
		NOTE: the entire image, assuming it is bigger than the containing element, will
              pan right or left, up or down, within the container. This is good. The
              coordinates of the image stay.
Use translate3d to put image anywhere in the container
	Understand how percentages work - DONE
	Understand if any clipping occurs - DONE
		NOTE: the image, as shown in the container, is simply moved around the screen.
              The image is not panned or zoomed as done with background-position. The
			  coordinates of the image are moved.
Zoom image with scale3d and then try to move image with background-position - DONE
	NOTE: I can pan the entire image from left to right or top to bottom, if I
          first, scale the image, and then second, pan the image with background-position.
Zoom image with scale3d and then try to move image with translate3d - DONE
    NOTE: doesn't work. translate3d just moves the image origin around on the screen - not what I want.
Try to position the image after zoom to any corner of the image - DONE
Try to scale and position in one transform. - DONE

Discovered that I couldn't use the transforms scale3d or transform3d. Instead, I ended up using
background-size and background-position. Those would let me zoom in and pan around the image just
like I wanted.
